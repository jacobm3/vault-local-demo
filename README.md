# Vault dev mode demo scripts

## Intro

These files can be used to start a local Vault instance in dev mode for easy demos of the following engines:

- KV
- Dynamic Mysql credentials
- Dynamic AWS Access Keys
- Dynamic Azure Service Principals
- Dynamic GCP Access Tokens
- PKI
- Vault Agent + Consul Template

## Instructions

The numbered files (NN-step-name.sh) are shell scripts that individually configure Vault. You can walk a customer through these steps individually or just start the first five from start.sh.
